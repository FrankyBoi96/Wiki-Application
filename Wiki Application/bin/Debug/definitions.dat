ArrayArrayLinearéA linear array, often referred to as a one-dimensional array, stands out as a foundational data structure. It serves as a systematic arrangement of components, all sharing a common data type, and residing in end-to-end memory slots. HeapTree
Non-Linear˜A heap is the completed version of a binary tree that meets the heap property.  For each node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.Linked listListLinear¾A linked list is used to store sequences of components.  Each component within the linked list is referred to as a node, and for every node in list is referred to the next node within list. ListListLinearšA list, in the context of abstract data types, is a set of numbers in ordered values, where the same value can appear more than once. Lists are fundamental containers, capable of holding other values. When identical values are present, each occurrence is treated as a separate item.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearÆA self-balancing tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearÍA multidimensional array refers to a data structure capable of storing information across multiple dimensions, enabling the arrangement of data in a grid-like format. This arrangement proves valuable for showing complex data relationships and conducting operations on data that fundamentally align with a multi-dimensional framework.
